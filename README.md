# Advent of Code 2021 in R

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) in R. My goal is to solve every puzzle using nothing else but base R functions and _without any data frames_ or data frame manipulation functions (matrices, n-dimensional arrays and linear algebra operations are OK).

The "solutions as an R package" method is inspired by [\@tjmahr](https://github.com/tjmahr/adventofcode17)'s approach to Advent of Code 2017. Briefly, each script under `R/` contains the functions needed to solve the puzzle on a given day. Unit tests under `tests/` verify that my solutions adhere to the requirements given by each puzzle specification, using the tiny testing data on the Advent of Code website. Finally, `inst/` contains small standalone R scripts which solve the full puzzles stored in text files under `inst/extdata` and output the results to the terminal. All are executed by a master script in `inst/run-all.R`.

### Why on Earth would you use R for this?

Several reasons. First, R is my favourite programming language. There, I said it.

Second, I spend nearly all time at my job doing data analysis and research&mdash;nearly everything I work with on a daily basis are (gigantic) tables, the usual output of my work are figures and statistical models. Advent of Code presents a very different class of problems that I rarely get to work with these days and it seemed like a fun challenge trying to solve them in R. Moreover, as an additional challenge and a character building experience I decided to restrict myself to only use features available in base R 4.x without any additional packages and without using any data frames or functions that manipulate them (again, something that is very unusual when working with R).

### Personal stats

I'm definitely not speed-running this. üòé üèñ üçπ Mostly working on this during breaks throughout the day.
